"""Banking knowledge base for Ask Vasool Raja.

General questions ("how do I download my statement?", "what is a KFS?",
"can the bank charge me for SMS?") are answered from this curated set, matched
by keyword overlap + fuzzy similarity. Entries link to rulebook ids where a
right is involved, so the answer can quote the rule and its source.

Everything here is general guidance about Indian banking; nothing here decides
whether *your* bank owes *you* money — only the rule engine does that.
